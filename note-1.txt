Excellent! I found very useful references. Let me search for more on the importance of urban-rural classification for policy and planning.Searched the webLet me search for more specific information about why accurate urban-rural classification matters for resource allocation and policy.Searched the webThis is excellent! I found a very relevant paper specifically about Harbin, China. Let me search for one more thing about the classic definition from Pryor (1968) which seems to be the seminal work.Searched the webI now have excellent information. Let me summarize what I've found and provide you with a comprehensive understanding to improve your paper.

Summary of What I Found
1. The Classic Definition (Pryor 1968) - This is THE foundational reference
The urban-rural fringe (URF) is the zone of transition in land use, social and demographic characteristics, lying between (a) the continuously built-up urban and suburban areas of the central city, and (b) the rural hinterland, characterized by the almost complete absence of non-farm dwellings, occupations and land use.

This is the seminal paper you should cite:

Pryor, R. J. (1968). "Defining the Rural-Urban Fringe." Social Forces, Vol. 47, No. 2, pp. 202-215.

2. The Core/Fringe/Rural Classification is Well-Established
The literature consistently uses this three-zone model:

Core (Urban): High-density built-up area, central city
Fringe (Peri-urban/Urban-Rural Fringe): Transition zone with mixed land use
Rural: Agricultural land, low population density

It is the zone of transition between built-up area of the city and its rural umland or hinterland... It is a zone of mixed land use, culture, language, dresses and demographic characteristics. The fringe starts from the point where agricultural land use appears while moving outwards from the city. Pan Geography
3. Why This Classification Matters for Policy
From my search, here are the key reasons urban region classification is important:
a) Infrastructure Planning:
A planning zone, including urban... hierarchy which eventually provides the continuity of the rural characters, to maintain agricultural productivity and to protect natural biodiversity. ScienceDirect
b) Managing Urban Sprawl:
The urban-rural fringe is in a state of dynamic change, with the urban fringe gradually moving towards the cities, and the rural fringe continuing to expand and move into the countryside... Therefore, identifying the urban-rural fringe is of great significance for urban construction planning, rural revitalisation, urban-rural integration and urban economic transformation. Taylor & Francis Online
c) Sustainable Development:
Planning where development should or should not go can help a rural community encourage growth in town, where businesses can thrive on a walkable main street and families can live close to their daily destinations. US EPA
4. Current Methods in Urban Planning Literature
The existing methods are primarily:

Threshold-based classification (subjective, manual thresholds)
Remote sensing (land cover, impervious surface area)
K-means clustering on indicators
Neural networks (recent work, similar to your approach!)

Although the methods for identifying the urban-rural fringe are evolving and becoming more diverse, the majority of these approaches is based on an artificial threshold with high subjectivity, lacking objective mathematical methods. ScienceDirect
5. Very Relevant Recent Paper on Wuhan (2023)
It is noticed from Figure 4 and Table 2 that the urban area has the highest values in BLD, RD, PD, SPD, and TI. In other words, the urban core has a high built-up density, intensive road network, abundant POIs, as well as intensive taxi trips. The fringe areas show more fragmented and diverse landscape. MDPI
6. There's Even a Paper About Harbin!
Urban fringe is an active expanding belt, indicating urban-rural interaction processes. Previous studies have attempted to define urban fringe as the transitional area between urban and rural areas, but there is a lack of quantitative analysis of the periphery boundaries. MDPI
